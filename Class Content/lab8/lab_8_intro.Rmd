## Review from last time
### *With a partner, discuss the following questions*
1. How did midterm #1 go? Will you change anything for next time?  
2. We are going to start thinking about class projects soon- do you have any idea on what you would like to work on? Think in terms of data.
3. Assume you are part of a lab collecting data on plant growth. There are 1000 plants that you measure every day for 10 weeks. How would you set-up this spreadsheet?

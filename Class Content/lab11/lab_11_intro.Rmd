## Seating & Set-up
1. Please make sure that you sit next to your group members for the rest of the quarter.
2. Please set-up your computer as normal.

## Group project  
We will meet in our groups today to compare the data sets that we found so far. Questions to consider:  

1. Does it have a mix of variables?  
2. Does it have a story to tell?
3. Is there enough to show the range of skills we have learned this quarter?    

Remember, in the end you will need to deliver a 5-6 minute presentation of your work. If you need help, please ask!

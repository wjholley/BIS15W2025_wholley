4. Download a copy the class repository to the desktop.  
5. Clone your repository to the desktop using GitHub Desktop.  
6. Copy the files for today's lab from the class repository and paste them into **your** repository.  
7. Open today's lab in RStudio.  

## Review from last time
### *With a partner, discuss the following questions*
1. What is the difference between R and RStudio?  
2. What is GitHub and GitHub Desktop and why are they useful to programmers?  

## AI
1. In BIS 15L, we will use AI as a tool to make us more efficient programmers.  
2. Generating a README is a great example.  
3. But, I need to ask you to **please refrain** from AI until I say it is OK.
